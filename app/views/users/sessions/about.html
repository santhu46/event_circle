						The complexity intrinsic in today’s events is growing exponentially. Meaningful, independent, third party validated data can make sense of this complexity and allow sponsors to choose events that will provide a sufficient ROI, making sponsorship a lucrative venture. Of importance in this regard is being able to utilize the data to differentiate between events and allow sponsorship of events to be dictated by pre-specified target demographic objectives and informed marketing decisions within industry segments. This will allow sponsors to feel confident about their investment, and allow for continued feedback as to what future sponsorship will prove valuable.

						<p>
						Events today must balance the expectations and experiences of the guest with the limitations and proclivities of the host.  Increasingly complex needs and expectations are making the attainment of equilibrium somewhat elusive. Developing meaningful events that address these realities isn’t easy. For events to achieve lasting results and be considered worthy of future patronage, they must find a way to meet or exceed expectations. This makes knowing and accommodating expectations a competitive advantage and central for the success of an event. 
						</p>
						<p>Is your event organized in a way that can create meaningful results and accommodate the changing needs of both sponsors and guests? Do you want more engagement and connection before, during, and after the event? Do you want more people to know about your event? Do you want to create multiple events that run concurrently in support of an important cause? 
						</p>
						</p>
						The EC allows the host to have a deeper understanding of who their guests are and why they are attending their event.  It also creates the opportunity to maintain a connection with the guest before, during, and after the event. The event data available through the state of the art EC Assessment tool also allows hosts to better attract and work with sponsors, making sponsorship worthwhile throughout the event process.

						The amount of potential events a person can patronize is limitless. The information available to inform the patron of its efficacy with regard to them is often vague. Is it meaningful to you? Do you know what the event is all about and why it is important for you to attend that event at this stage of your life? Is there a vehicle in place to express any expectations you may have on the kind of experience you want to have before during and after the event? Does the event you are attending align with your goals? Check back with us and utilize The EC tool, which gives you comprehensive feedback informing you as to whether an event is appropriate for you at this time.
