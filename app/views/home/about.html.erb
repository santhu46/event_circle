						The complexity intrinsic in todayâ€™s events is growing exponentially. Meaningful, independent, third party validated data can make sense of this complexity and allow sponsors to choose events that will provide a sufficient ROI, making sponsorship a lucrative venture. Of importance in this regard is being able to utilize the data to differentiate between events and allow sponsorship of events to be dictated by pre-specified target demographic objectives and informed marketing decisions within industry segments. This will allow sponsors to feel confident about their investment, and allow for continued feedback as to what future sponsorship will prove valuable.
